IDMVis is a tool for visualizing Type 1 Diabetes patient Data. It has three panels- the overview panel, the detail panel and the summary statistics panel. The summary statistics panel has two views- the technician view and the patient view.

To start IDMVis, pull a latest copy of the code and start the server locally by running ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000``` on your terminal. To access it, go to 0.0.0.0:8000 in your Chrome browser.

On the left side of the screen, is the overview panel. Below overview panel is the detail panel and on the right side is the summary statistics panel. 

To select a dataset, use the dropdown on the leftmost side of the top navigation bar. 

To select the 14-day time period use the date picker next to the dataset dropdown.
